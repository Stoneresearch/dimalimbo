# LIMBO-Inspired Enhancements

Your DIMBO game has been enhanced to capture the **dark, atmospheric essence** of the classic LIMBO game while fixing all positioning issues.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Fixed

### 1. **UI Positioning Issues** âœ…
- **Fixed all hard-coded positions** that caused displacement
- **Proper centering** for all UI elements (title, name entry, leaderboard)
- **Responsive margins** that scale correctly with UI settings
- **Consistent spacing** throughout all screens

### 2. **LIMBO-Inspired Aesthetic** âœ…
- **Dark atmosphere**: Deep blacks and subtle grays replace bright neon colors
- **Silhouette-style player**: Pure black player figure like LIMBO's protagonist
- **Atmospheric backgrounds**: Layered silhouettes and subtle fog effects
- **Threatening obstacles**: Dark shapes with subtle danger glow
- **Minimal particles**: Understated atmospheric effects

### 3. **Enhanced Backgrounds** âœ…
Three LIMBO-inspired environments:
- `limbo_forest`: Dark forest with layered hill silhouettes (default)
- `limbo_industrial`: Industrial wasteland with factory silhouettes  
- Default: Pure darkness with subtle fog gradient

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Changes

### Before (Neon/Cyberpunk)
- Bright cyan player (`color.RGBA{0, 255, 220, 255}`)
- Magenta obstacles (`color.RGBA{255, 40, 140, 255}`)
- Flashy 3D text effects with curves and extrusion
- Complex animations and bright particles

### After (LIMBO-Style)
- **Pure black player silhouette** (`color.RGBA{0, 0, 0, 255}`)
- **Dark gray obstacles** with subtle red danger glow
- **Clean, centered text** with soft atmospheric glow
- **Minimal particles** with muted colors

## ðŸŽ® Preserved Original Features

âœ… **All your existing gameplay** - movement, collision, scoring
âœ… **Settings system** - still configurable via `settings.json`
âœ… **Leaderboard** - SQLite storage and caching unchanged
âœ… **Web deployment** - WASM build process unchanged
âœ… **Performance** - same efficient rendering pipeline
âœ… **Controls** - WASD, mouse, touch, gamepad support

## ðŸ”§ Background Options

Edit `settings.json` to try different atmospheres:
```json
{
  "backgroundStyle": "limbo_forest",    // Layered forest silhouettes
  "backgroundStyle": "limbo_industrial", // Factory wasteland
  "backgroundStyle": "default"          // Pure darkness with fog
}
```

## ðŸš€ Ready to Play
